* bug: old lines left in route tables
* bug: highlight on some lines does not work (related to previous one?)
* do not highlight unreachable routes
* put route on top of the graph when highlighted
* change route colors (installed, not installed, unreachable)
* change neighbour colors (based on rxcost)
* warn if txcost > 2*rxcost?
* zoom with mouse wheel
* do not randomize on zoom (hard to do)
* resize graph automatically with window size
